#Day -1
The induction program of our college, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), was a memorable start to our academic journey. It offered a blend of spiritual, academic, and social experiences, helping us get a better understanding of the institution and what lies ahead.
The day began with a visit to Gurudwara Sahib within the campus. We participated in a serene and calming paath (prayer session), which set a peaceful and positive tone for the day. It was a thoughtful way to begin, aligning with the spiritual values the college is rooted in.
After the prayer session, a tea break was arranged for all the attendees. Although refreshments were provided, the arrangements was well-organised. 
We then moved to the college auditorium, where the formal part of the induction began. The session started with a warm welcome and an insightful address by Dr. Sehajpal, the Principal. He explained the curriculum structure of GNDEC and highlighted various opportunities the university provides to its students.
This was followed by Prof. Harpreet Kaur, Head of the Applied Sciences Department, who gave us an overview of the academic support available during the foundation year. Her words were encouraging and made us feel more confident about entering this new phase of life.
A special highlight of the session was the speech by S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, former Cabinet Minister and trustee of the Nankana Sahib Trust, which supports and funds the university. He shared his vision for the institution and the importance of discipline, education, and heritage. His words were inspiring and added a larger perspective to the role our education will play in society.
Post this session, we had a lunch break, after which we went on a tour of the Mechanical Engineering department. During this familiarisation session, we met several department faculty members and were introduced to the labs and infrastructure. It was a great opportunity to get a firsthand look at the facilities and understand the environment where we will be spending a significant part of our academic journey.
