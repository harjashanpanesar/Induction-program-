#Day -1
The induction program of our college, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), was a memorable start to our academic journey. It offered a blend of spiritual, academic, and social experiences, helping us get a better understanding of the institution and what lies ahead.

The day began with a visit to Gurudwara Sahib within the campus. We participated in a serene and calming paath (prayer session), which set a peaceful and positive tone for the day. It was a thoughtful way to begin, aligning with the spiritual values the college is rooted in.

After the prayer session, a tea break was arranged for all the attendees. Although refreshments were provided, the arrangements was well-organised. 

We then moved to the college auditorium, where the formal part of the induction began. The session started with a warm welcome and an insightful address by Dr. Sehajpal, the Principal. He explained the curriculum structure of GNDEC and highlighted various opportunities the university provides to its students.

This was followed by Prof. Harpreet Kaur, Head of the Applied Sciences Department, who gave us an overview of the academic support available during the foundation year. Her words were encouraging and made us feel more confident about entering this new phase of life.

A special highlight of the session was the speech by S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, former Cabinet Minister and trustee of the Nankana Sahib Trust, which supports and funds the university. He shared his vision for the institution and the importance of discipline, education, and heritage. His words were inspiring and added a larger perspective to the role our education will play in society.

Post this session, we had a lunch break, after which we went on a tour of the Mechanical Engineering department. During this familiarisation session, we met several department faculty members and were introduced to the labs and infrastructure. It was a great opportunity to get a firsthand look at the facilities and understand the environment where we will be spending a significant part of our academic journey.

On the second day of induction programm we enjoyed a lot. The day was planned with a series of informative sessions, expert lectures, and assessments aimed at helping us understand the institution and prepare for our academic journey.

The day began with our arrival at the college campus. We proceeded to the auditorium, where the first session was conducted by Dr. Priya Darshini Madam, who delivered an insightful lecture on Universal Human Values. Her session focused especially on happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. The session was enlightening, providing a fresh perspective on how we can achieve true happiness. It was an inspiring session that encouraged us to think deeply about ethical behavior and human connection.

Following this, we attended another session in the auditorium by Dr. Aravind Tingara, the Director and STEP In-charge of TAC. He provided us with comprehensive information about the college, including its structure, available resources, and support systems for students. Moreover in this lecture we wnjoyed a lot , we played a lot of games in team and solo with gives us confidence to face the audience on stage .

After this, information about Satyaâ€™s Scholarship Program was shared with us. This program is specially designed to support students from financially weaker backgrounds. It was announced that students who qualify under this scheme would have all their college fees fully paid for the remainder of their academic duration, which was a very encouraging initiative for many students.

Following these sessions, we were given a lunch break, allowing us to relax and prepare for the proficiency tesf conducted by college.

After the break, we returned to our respective classes where the college conducted a proficiency test. The first test was the English Proficiency Test, held from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM. In this test, we were given several questions that included writing an email and a letter, testing our writing skills and gramatical knowledge .

After completing the English test, we appeared for the Maths Proficiency Test, where we were required to solve basic numericals. This helped assess our mathematical knowledge .

After successfully completing both tests, we concluded our day and returned home.

DAY-3

The third day of our college induction program was both informative and engaging, offering us deeper insight into college life, clubs, human values, and technical learning.

The day began as per schedule with all students gathering in the auditorium at 8:30 AM. The session opened with a prayer, where we remembered and thanked God. This moment of reflection set a peaceful and respectful tone for the rest of the day.

Following the prayer, the first lecture was conducted by the Cosmic Club. The speakers provided detailed information about the various events, programs, and activities organized by the club throughout the academic year. We were introduced to exciting competitions such as Bhangra, Apex, Akme, and many others. These events were said to be held branch-wise and included participation from various engineering disciplines, colleges, and even schools.

The post-lunch session started with a lecture by Professor Jaswant Singh, the Head of the Coding Department. He shared insightful knowledge about the importance of coding in fields like mechanical engineering and robotics. He began by engaging students with questions such as why they chose this particular field, which led to a healthy and polite discussion. He then introduced us to various programming languages and explained the basic system requirements for different coding applications relevant to our field. His session helped us understand the growing significance of digital skills in engineering careers.
